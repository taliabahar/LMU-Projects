# LMU Projects 

This repository houses the various projects and assignments I completed during my time at Loyola Marymount University. 

## Courses 

[**CMSI 186 Programming Lab**](https://github.com/taliabahar/CMSI-186-ProgrammingLab): **Java** programming lab focused on dynamic programming. Typical projects include discrete simulation, randomized estimation, maze solving, dynamic programming, large-number arithmetic, and numerical methods.

[**CMSI 281 Data Structures**](https://github.com/taliabahar/CMSI-281-DataStructures): Classwork and homework assignments designed to provide an introduction to data types, information structures, and algorithms. All work done in **Java**. 

[**CMSI 282 Algorithms**] : Algorithm paradigms, with an emphasis on combinatoral search. Topics include: generating combinatorial objects; greedy methods, dynamic programming; randomized algorithms; modern heuristics such as genetic programs and simulated annealing; advanced sorts and order statistics; cake-cutting and fair division; graph algorithms; computational geometry. All work done in **Java**. 

[**CMSI 284 Computer Systems Organization**] : An introduction to the basic organization of computer systems. Digital representation of textual and numeric information. Machine instructions and instruction formats, assemblers and assembly languages, linking and loading, process execution, interrupt and device-handling, and file management. System-level programming in **C** and **assembly language**.

[**CMSI 370 Interaction Design**] : Introduction to interaction design and human-computer interaction, with equal emphasis on learning how to design and evaluate interaction architectures, and learning how to use existing frameworks to implement such architectures. Course project coded with **React Hooks** and utilized the Shippo and MapBox APIs to create an efficient package tracking web app. 

[**CMSI 371 Computer Graphics**](https://github.com/taliabahar/CMSI-371-ComputerGraphics): Introduction to interactive computer graphics. Topics include the design and use of three-dimensional graphics engines and APIs, animation, physics and computer games, 3D modeling, computational geometry, shading, ray tracing, and fractal geometry. All projects coded in **C++** and used GLUT and OpenGL libraries.

[**CMSI 386 Programming Languages**](https://github.com/taliabahar/CMSI-386-ProgrammingLanguages): A comparative study of the rationale, concepts, design, and features of several major programming languages including, **JavaScript**, **Java**, **Python**, **Swift**, **C++**, **C**, and **Haskell**. 

[**CMSI 387 Operating Systems**](https://github.com/taliabahar/CMSI387-MayaTaliaVeronica): Learned about concepts in the design of operating systems, including processes, process management, mutual exclusion, synchronization and message-passing, primary memory management, multiprogramming, paged allocation and paging policies, resource and I/O management, file systems, and security. Problems coded in **C** and **Java**.

[**CMSI 399 App Development Practicum**] : Course designed to teach students React and prepare students for the work force through group projects, that stand and share/team stuff, and interview questions.
Worked on two **React** web applications with 3 other students per project that utilized the Spoonacular and Petfinder APIs. Interview questions coded in **JavaScript**.

[**CMSI 486 Introduction to Database Systems**](https://github.com/taliabahar/CMSI-486-Databases): Introduction to the theory and design of database systems. Database assignments completed using **MongoDB** and **Neo4j**.

[**CMSI 488 Language Translation and Implementation**](https://github.com/taliabahar/CMSI488): Introduction to the theory and design of translators and interpreters for high-level computer programming languages. Topics covered in assignments include programming language specification, scanner construction, parser construction, intermediate representations, virtual machines, regexes, code generation, and optimization. Culminated course by creating a new programming language from scratch with 5 other students coded in **JavaScript**.

## Projects

[**Should I Stay or Should I Go?**](https://github.com/taliabahar/React-TaliaWengelKeziahJoshua): **React Hooks** web app I colloborated on with three other students that uses the Sponacular API to compare the convenience (in terms of time) and cost of an inputted meal to help users decide whether they should eat at home or at a restaurant. Upon searching for a meal users are presented with detailed information such as location (of restaurant) or recipe (if cooking at home). Served as SCRUM Master on project. 

[**Pet Match**](https://github.com/taliabahar/pet-match): **React Hooks** web app I colloborated on with three other students that uses the Petfinder API to help users find adoptable animals near them that match their needs/desires by taking a short quiz. Came up with concept and served as Project Manager with the goal to promote the adoption of shelter animals to help save animals who are being put down due to shelters closing down and help mitigate the anxiety and boredom quarantining has caused. Coded in **JavaScript** and **React Hooks** and uses React Router and the Petfinder API.

[**The Whole Story**](https://github.com/taliabahar/tws-client): News centered web app I worked on as the UI/UX lead + Front End Deveoloper as part of the Mozilla Builders LMU Spring 2020 Hackternship with two other students. I also created all the art work for the site myself. The Whole Story's goal was to help the younger generation become politically-informed in a hollistic manner by removing avenues for implicit bias to enter their news stream leading to a deeper and more individualistic political understanding. Coded in **React Hooks**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and utilized Material UI. 

[**RE Climate Webapp**](https://github.com/lmu-climate/lmu-climate-webapp): RE is an evironmental focused **React** webapp I worked on as the UI/UX lead + Front End Developer. I also created all the art work for the site myself. Coded in React, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **SCSS**. 

[**Inkling**](https://github.com/taliabahar/Inkling-1): Collaborated with five other LMU Students to create Inkling. Inkling is a programming language that lets you follow your gut—you learn to program by doing what makes sense to you while learning to shift your thinking to grow as a programmer and as a thinker. It is a simple English-modeled and statically typed language made to help beginner programmers step into coding and then easily transition into other languages. Coded in **JavaScript** and uses **Ohm** and **Jest** + Personally created [Inkling informational website](https://github.com/taliabahar/Inkling) using **React** and Bootstrap. 

[**Astrology**](https://github.com/taliabahar/astrology):
